Install pip (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/):

.. code:: bash

   curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
   
   python get-pip.py

.. code:: bash

    pip install -U cryptography

Sometimes this does not work. Please try::

    pip3 install -U bhive

or::

    python -m pip install bhive

Manual installation
-------------------
    
You can install bhive from this repository if you want the latest
but possibly non-compiling version::

    git clone https://github.com/thecrazygmn/bhive.git
    cd bhive
    python setup.py build
    
    python setup.py install --user

Run tests after install::

    pytest
    
    
Installing bhive with conda-forge
---------------------------------

Installing bhive from the conda-forge channel can be achieved by adding conda-forge to your channels with::

    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    
Once the conda-forge channel has been enabled, bhive can be installed with::

    conda install bhive

Signing and Verify can be fasten (200 %) by installing cryptography::

    conda install cryptography

Enable Logging
--------------

Add the following for enabling logging in your python script::

    import logging
    log = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

When you want to see only critical errors, replace the last line by::

    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.CRITICAL)
